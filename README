Use visualise_orbitals.py for visualisation, when cube file already exists.
Use generate_orbitals.py for calculation of cube file and visualisation afterwards.
Copy visualise_orbitals.py or generate_orbitals.py to the directory with your calculation of the orbitals.
File Formats: <molecule_file>: all formats, accepted by VMD for molecule coordinates; <orbitals_file>: should always be cube (generated by waveplot/cubegen)
Execute the scripts with:
    python3 visualise_orbitals.py <molecule_file> <orbitals_file>
    python3 generate_orbitale.py <molecule_file>                      (Has to be xyz file in this case)
You will be asked for your choices:
    Total Number of Orbitals to be calculated,
    Numbers of the Orbitals, which are to be calculated and
    Visualisation (Background and Molecule Drawing Style) and potential generation of a Movie of the rotation.
